# Web Visualization Dashboard (Lattitude)

## Background
Data is more powerful when we share it with others! 

In this project, a web visualization dashboard is created to show off the analysis of weather changes at different latitudes relative to the equator line. The data visualization shows temperature, humidity, cloudiness and wind speed trend. It also provided insights that cities closer to the equator line are warmer.

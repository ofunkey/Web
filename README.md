## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

In this project, a web visualization dashboard is created to show off the analysis of weather changes at different latitudes relative to the equator line. The data visualization shows temperature, humidity, cloudiness and wind speed trend using HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap4. It also provided insights that cities closer to the equator line are warmer.
